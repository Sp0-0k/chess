# My Notes:

### September 16th Notes:
#### Good software:
* Solves the customer's problem today
* Also solves tomorrow's problem

We do this via Abstraction, Immutability, and Encapsulation

#### Abstraction: Appearing to the need
Giving the information need to know in the context you are in.
#### Polymorphism: many forms -- How we achieve abstraction
Achieved with interfaces (implements) and inheritance (extends)

An interface defines the role of something, the inheritance utilizes it. See exampleCode.txt for examples.

Compare an interface to a game controller and a inheritance to the game code that "assigns" the buttons
